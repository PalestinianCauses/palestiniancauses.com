          <SubSectionHeading>What is a cookie?</SubSectionHeading>
          <Paragraph>
            A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your
            device when you visit. It typically contains information about the
            website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to
            recognize your web browser when you return, additional data that
            serves the cookie&apos;s purpose, and the cookie&apos;s lifespan.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Cookies are used to enable certain features (e.g., logging in),
            track site usage (e.g., analytics), store your user settings (e.g.,
            time zone, notification preferences), and personalize your content
            (e.g., advertising, language).
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Cookies set by the website you visit are usually called first-party
            cookies. They typically only track your activity on that particular
            site.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Cookies set by other sites and companies (i.e., third parties) are
            called third-party cookies. They can track you on other websites
            that use the same third-party service.

            How Can You Control Our Website&apos;s Use of Cookies?

            You can decide whether to accept or reject cookies on our website.
            You can manage your cookie preferences in our Cookie Consent
            Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
            categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies can
            not be dismissed as they are strictly necessary to provide you with
            the services on our website.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            You can also set or amend your cookie preferences by managing your
            web browser settings. As each web browser is different, please
            consult the instructions provided by your web browser (typically in
            the &ldquo;help&ldquo; section). You may still use the website if
            you refuse to use it or turn off cookies. However, some of its
            functionality may not be available to you.
