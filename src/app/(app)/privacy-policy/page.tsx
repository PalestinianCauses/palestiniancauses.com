            Suppose your personal information is no longer required for this

            The personal information we collect is stored and/or processed in
            the United Kingdom by us. Following an adequacy decision by the EU

            request that we restrict the processing of your personal information
            if (i) you are concerned about the accuracy of your personal
            information, (ii) you believe your personal information has been
            unlawfully processed, (iii) you need us to maintain the personal
            information solely for a legal claim, or (iv) we are in the process
            of considering your objection about processing based on legitimate
            interests.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            <strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can object to processing your
            personal information based on your legitimate interests or public
            interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling, legitimate
            grounds for the processing, which overrides your interests, rights,
            and freedoms, to proceed with processing your personal information.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            <strong>Right to be Informed:</strong> You have the right to be

            organizations. However, this is a qualified right; it is not
            absolute and may only apply in certain circumstances.

            The company relies on legitimate interests as a legal basis for
            processing personal data, and an individual has the right to object.
            It has been determined that the company has no overriding legitimate
            grounds to refuse that request.

            objects to that processing.

            <strong>Right to Portability:</strong> Individuals can get some of

            machine-readable, for example, as a CSV file. Individuals also have
            the right to ask an organization to transfer their data to another
            organization.
          </Paragraph>

            <strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If personal data is
            inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete, individuals have the right to
            correct, update, or complete that data. Collectively, this is
            referred to as the right to rectification. Rectification may involve
            filling the gaps, i.e., having incomplete personal data completed –
            although this will depend on the purposes for the processing. This
            may include adding a supplementary statement to the incomplete data
            to highlight inaccuracies or claims.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            This right only applies to an individual&apos;s data; a person can
            not seek the rectification of another person&apos;s information.

          <Paragraph>
            By PIPEDA, we broaden our definition of personal information to
            include any information about an individual, such as financial
            information, information about your appearance, your views and
            opinions (such as those expressed online or through a survey),
            opinions held about you by others, and any personal correspondences
            you may have with us. While this information may not directly
            identify you, be aware that it may be combined with other
            information to do so.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            As PIPEDA refers to personal information using the term Personally
            Identifying Information (PII), any references to personal
            information and PII in this privacy policy and official

            Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal

            assume your consent based on your positive contact action when you
            contact us. Therefore, your consent for your name and email address
            is required so we can respond to your inquiry. Under PIPEDA, consent
            is only valid if it is reasonable to expect that an individual to
            whom the organization&apos;s activities are directed would
            understand the nature, purpose, and consequences of the collection,
            use, or disclosure of the personal information to which they

            businesses subject to this law. Under PIPEDA, you must make your

          <Paragraph>
            You have the right to complain about organizational fees that seem

            your PII to you. We will take all necessary measures to fulfill your
            request within 30 days of receipt. Otherwise, we must inform you of
            our inability to do so before the 30-day timeframe if:

            <li>
              The time required to undertake consultations necessary to respond
